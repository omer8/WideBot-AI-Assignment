# Classification on the Hespress News Dataset
This project aims to classify news articles from the Moroccan news website "Hespress" into different categories using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains articles from various categories such as politics, sports, economy, and culture.

# Training Process
### 1- Data Preprocessing:
* Load the dataset from CSV files.
* Clean and preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and normalization.
* Convert the target labels into numerical values.
  
### 2- Feature Engineering:

* Extract features from the tokenized data using CountVectroizer and TF-IDF.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Model Training:

### 3 - Train and evaluate different machine learning models on the feature-engineered data, such as Logistic Regression, Random Fores, or SVM.
* Evaluate the performance of the selected model on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
